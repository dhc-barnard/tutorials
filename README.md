# [Scalar I](https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/scalar/Scalar%20I.md)
## Introduction to the tool:
Scalar is a free, open-source tool for digital authoring and publishing that “enables users to assemble media from multiple sources and juxtapose them with their own writing in a variety of ways, with minimal technical expertise required” ([Scalar website](https://scalar.me/anvc/scalar/)).

## Materials:
- Internet access
- Reliable web browser (preferably Chrone or Firefox)
- Access to your email
- An account at [scalar.usc.edu](https://scalar.me/anvc/) or your own Scalar install

## Learning Goals:
- Understand how you might use Scalar to think digitally about narrative structure and autonomous readers
- Create a sample Scalar book to share with your students

### This tool is great for:
- Projects with lots of writing
- Connecting media to text
- Multi-linear narratives (think choose-your-own-adventure)

### This tool is not great for:
- Storing lots of images or large images (if your project is object-centered, try [Omeka](https://www.omeka.net/) or [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/) instead)

# [Scalar II](https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/scalar/Scalar%20II.md)

## Introduction to the tool:
Scalar is a digital publishing platform that allows creators to juxtapose media and text and create multi-linear pathways through their books or projects. Scalar has robust features out-of-the-box, but it also provides advanced features to creators who want to take their projects to the next level. We'll explore a few of those features in this tutorial.
 
This tutorial  assumes that you have already created a Scalar book that includes content, tags, and paths. If your Scalar book does not have these features, please add them before proceeding. You may want to refer back to the Introduction to Scalar I module or review [Scalar's Quickstart Guides](https://scalar.usc.edu/works/guide2/quickstarts?path=index).

## Learning Goals:
- Practice and experiment with som eof Scalar's more advanced features to test its affordances and limitations.
- Create metadata to visualize connections among content.

### This tool is great for:
- Dipping your toes in CSS, Javascript, and web design customizations

### This tool is not great for:
- Simultaneous editing of the same Scalar book
- Version control of your custom code (use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) for this).
