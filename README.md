# Barnard Digital Humanities Center Tutorials

Here we have tutorials for the techonologies that our center supports. These tools encapsulate our values, such as sustainability, collaboration, and exploration. We hope to empower your project decisions by identifying advantages/disadvantages of each tool and by encouraging self-reflective tool use.

## Our Tutorials:
* [Beginner Scalar](#scalar-i)
* [Intermediate Scalar](#scalar-ii)
* [StoryMapJS](#storymapjs)
* [TimelineJS](#timelinejs)

# Scalar I
## Introduction to the tool:

Scalar is a free, open-source tool for digital authoring and publishing that "enables users to assemble media from multiple soucres and juxtapose them with their own writing in a variety of ways, with minimal technical expertise required" ([Scalar website](https://scalar.me/anvc/scalar/)).

**Our Beginner Scalar tutorial is located here: [Scalar I.md](https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/Scalar%20I.md)**

### This tool is great for:
* Projects with lots of writing
* Connecting media to text
* Multi-linear narratives (think choose-your-own-adventure)

### This tool is not great for:
* Storing lots of images or large images (if your project is object-centered, try [Omeka](https://www.omeka.net/) or [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/) instead)

# Scalar II
## Introduction to the tool:

Scalar is a digital publishing platform that allows creators to juxtapose media and text and create multi-linear pathways through their books or projects. Scalar has robust features out-of-the-box, but it also provides advanced features to creators who want to take their projects to the next level. We'll explore a few of those features in this tutorial.

This tutorial assumes that you have already created a Scalar book that includes content, tags, and paths. If your Scalar book does not have these features, please add them before proceeding. You may want to refer back to the Introduction to Scalar I module or review [Scalar's Quickstart Guides](https://scalar.usc.edu/works/guide2/quickstarts?path=index).

**Our Intermediate Scalar tutorial is located here: [Scalar II.md](https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/Scalar%20II.md)**


### This tool is great for:
* Dipping your toes in CSS, Javascript, and web design customizations
### This tool is not great for:
* Simultaneous editing of the same Scalar book
* Version control of your custom code (use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/) for this).

# StoryMapJS
## Introduction to the tool:

StoryMap.js is a free, open-source tool that combines narratives with locations, letting users tell a media-rich story. It has an easy-to-use authoring tool that's robust enough for many uses, and can also be customized with code for more advanced projects.

**Our StoryMapJS tutorial is located here: [StoryMapJS.md](https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/StoryMapJS.md)**

### This tool is great for:
* Telling stories that have a spatial component
* Providing an in-depth look at any 2D visual object (work of art, diagram, historical or fictional maps)
* Quick, simple digital projects that stand on their own, or that can be included as part of a larger project
### This tool is not great for:
* Combining quantitative data with mapping
* Making extremely customized visuals
* Collaborating with multiple people on one StoryMap (particularly if you're not in the same physical space)

# TimelineJS
## Introduction to the tool:

TimelineJS is a free, open-source tool that allows you to make media-rich, chronological timelines. It can be helpful for illuminating cause and effect, putting stories into historical context, highlighting changes over a period of time and understanding the impact of time on narratives.

**Our TimelineJS tutorial is located here: [TimelineJS.md](https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/TimelineJS.md)**

### This tool is great for:
* Illuminating the chronological order of events to tell a clear story
* Visualizing how something changes over a period of time
* Smaller digital projects that stand on their own, or that can be included as part of a larger project
### This tool is not great for:
* Telling stories that don't move in a linear, chronological fashion 
* Making extremely customized visuals
* Showing how quantitative data changes over time (data visualization is a better tool for that)
