# Barnard Digital Humanities Center Tutorials

Here we have tutorials for the techonologies that our center supports. These tools encapsulate our values, such as sustainability, collaboration, and exploration. We hope to empower your project decisions by identifying advantages/disadvantages of each tool and by encouraging self-reflective tool use.

## Our Tutorials:
* [Beginner Scalar](#scalar-i)
* [Intermediate Scalar](#scalar-ii)

# Scalar I:
## Introduction to the tool:
Scalar is a free, open-source tool for digital authoring and publishing that "enables users to assemble media from multiple soucres and juxtapose them with their own writing in a variety of ways, with minimal technical expertise required" ([Scalar website](https://scalar.me/anvc/scalar/)).
Our Beginner Scalar tutorial is located here: [Scalar I.md](https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/Scalar%20I.md)
### This tool is great for:
* Projects with lots of writing
* Connecting media to text
* Multi-linear narratives (think choose-your-own-adventure)
### This tool is not great for:
* Storing lots of images or large images (if your project is object-centered, try [Omeka](https://www.omeka.net/) or [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/) instead)
# Scalar II
## Introduction to the tool:
Scalar is a digital publishing platform that allows creators to juxtapose media and text and create multi-linear pathways through their books or projects. Scalar has robust features out-of-the-box, but it also provides advanced features to creators who want to take their projects to the next level. We'll explore a few of those features in this tutorial.
This tutorial assumes that you have already created a Scalar book that includes content, tags, and paths. If your Scalar book does not have these features, please add them before proceeding. You may want to refer back to the Introduction to Scalar I module or review [Scalar's Quickstart Guides](https://scalar.usc.edu/works/guide2/quickstarts?path=index).
### This tool is great for:
* Dipoing you toes in CSS, Javascript, and web design customizations
### This tool is not great for:
* Simultaneous editing of the same Scalar book
* Version control of your custom code (use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/) for this).
