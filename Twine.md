## Introduction to the tool

Twine is an open-source tool for telling "interactive, nonlinear stories" online at [twinery.org](http://twinery.org/).

### This tool is great for:

- Multi-linear narratives (think choose-your-own-adventure)
- Projects with lots of writing
- Creating interactive fiction and games

### This tool is not great for:

- Visualizing data
- Collaborative projects (You must save and share your Twine story as an HTML file to work collaboratively)

### Materials:

- Internet access
- Reliable web browser (preferably Chrome or Firefox)

## Part 1 - Exploring Narrative Structure with Twine

*Adapted from Miriam Neptune's tutorials on exploring narrative structure with Twine*

Before you begin to work with Twine, you may want to explore possible structures to implement in your interactive narrative. Linked here is some background reading for creating interactive narratives: ["Interactive Narrative | Play with Learning"](http://playwithlearning.com/2010/10/14/exploring-interactive-narrative-part-1-of-6/), ["Serious Interactive Fiction: Constraints, Interfaces, and Creative Writing Pedagogy](https://scholarworks.rit.edu/jcws/vol3/iss1/10/), and ["Game Design as Narrative Architecture](http://web.mit.edu/~21fms/People/henry3/games&narrative.html). 

### Materials you will need:

-   20 Post-it notes or index cards
-   Markers

### Thinking about Narrative Structure

Think of a movie or a TV episode you watched recently. Think about the protagonist in that story. What happened for the character at the beginning, middle, and end of the story? What was their goal at the beginning, what obstacles did they face, and where did they end up? What was the climax of the story? Diagram the story. Below is an example of a way to illustrate story structure.

</p>

You can create a line and add some points, or list each plot point on a post it and try to arrange them in a shape indicating rising action, climax, falling action. Or maybe your story is circle, a straight line, or a non-linear experience! Twine has the capability to allow users to create branching narratives and non-linear narratives, and you can explore these narrative types as you learn more about the tool. 

## Part 2 - Twine Basics

### Step 1 - Getting Started

- Go to [twinery.org](http://twinery.org/). Here, you have two options for using Twine: you can download the application onto your computer where files will be saved locally in your Documents folder, or you can access the website through your web browser, where stories are saved in the browser's local storage. If you decide to download the application onto your computer, click the download link for your type of computer on the yellow sticky note on the right-hand side of the page. Follow the prompts to download. If you decide to use Twine online, click "use it online" on the yellow sticky note on the right-hand side of the page.
- Important things to remember when using Twine online are that clearing sessions and cookies in a browser may also clear the storage of Twine. If you clear your browser's data, you'll lose your work! Also, you need to use the same browser every time you use Twine because local storage is browser specific. Finally, anyone who uses your browser can see and make changes to your work if they access the Twine website. 

### Step 2 - Creating a New Story

To create a new story, click on the "+ story" symbol below the Twine logo on the right of the page.

<img align="right" width="20%" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/1-new%20story.png" alt="Screen grab of New Story Button">

Again, if you are using the browser-based version of Twine, the story file will be saved in your browser so if you erase your browser cache, your work will be deleted. Select 'Archive' *to* save your story as an html document. 

<img align="right" width="20%" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/2-archive.png" alt="Screen grab of Archive Button">

If you are using the desktop version of Twine, your story will be saved to your documents folder. If you would like to archive a particular version of your story, select "Archive" to save the most recently edited version as an html document. 

### Step 3 - Adding Content

Name your story: enter a name for your story (you can change this later!)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/3-name%20story.png" alt="Screen grab of naming story">
</p>

After you name your story, you will find yourself at a page that looks like a blueprint. You are now in the Passages View, where you can view all of the passages of your story. Right now you only have one passage in the middle of the screen labelled "Untitled Passage."

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/4-passage%20view.png" alt="Passages view">
</p>

Double click the box to edit the passage.

<p align="center">
  <img align="center" width="40%" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/5-untitled%20passage.png" alt="Double click this passage to edit">
</p>

Once opening the passage, you can edit its name, tags, and contents. To change the contents of the passage, double click the text "Double-click this passage to edit it" and add some content of your own. 

<p align="center">
  <img align="center" width="60%" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/6-double%20click.png" alt="Untitled Passage">
</p>

If you are just learning how to use twine, we suggest adding the following text: 
 > As soon as the hatch of your ship, the Coriolis, opens, you see the creatures swarming around you. There are many of them, more than you can easily count, and they are all continuously in motion. 
We will build on this content later. When you are done editing, close the passage editor by using the Escape key or by clicking the "x" in the upper right corner.
 
<p align="center">
  <img align="center" width="60%" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/7-text%201.png" alt="adding text">
</p>

### Step 4 - Playing a Story

Now that you've added some text to your story, play your story to see how it looks!

Once you have closed the passage editor and are in Passage View, you can see the Story Menu at the bottom of the screen. This menu allows you to navigate, change, and play your story. Click on the "Play" button in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. Your story will open as an HTML file in your web browser.

<p align="center">
  <img align="center" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/8-bottom%20menu.png" alt="story menu at the bottom of the screen">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img align="center" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/10-play%201.png" alt="story displayed in new tab">
</p>

### Step 5 - Connecting Passages

Make sure you are in the Passages View. Then, double-tap the "Untitled Passage" again. This time, add text at the bottom. You will be adding double opening and closing square brackets around your text to create a "passage link" to link connecting passages in your story. If you are using the suggested text we have provided, add the following text this time: 
 > [[Could this really be Earth!?]]
 
<p align="center">
  <img align="center" width="60%" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/11-text%202.png" alt="adding more text">
</p>

If you are exploring how to use Twine using your own story, add your own "next step" to your story. Remember to add two brackets around your phrase in order for your text to become a link to a new page. Close the passage editor by using the Escape key or by clicking the "x" in the upper right corner. Now that you are back in the Passages View, you can see two passages! If you click or drag either passage, you can see that the two passages are connected.  

<p align="center">
  <img align="center" width="40%" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/12-%20passages%202.png" alt="connected passages">
</p>

### Step 6 - Playing your Story Again

Now that you've added some more text to your story, play your story to see how it has changed!

Click on the "Play" button in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. Your story will open as an HTML file in your web browser. You can see an updated version of your story that includes the new link you just created. 

<p align="center">
  <img align="center" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/13%20-%20play%202.png" alt="edited story in new tab">
</p>

Passage links act both as connections between stories and as hyperlinks between passages in the story. If you click on the hyperlink, a new passage will load, but the new passage will include the default text "Double-click this passage to edit it."

<p align="center">
  <img align="center" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/14-%20play%202.png" alt="click on hyperlink">
</p>

### Step 7 - Editing your New Passage

Return to the Passage View and double-click the second passage you made. If you've been using the suggested text we've provided, the passage should be named "Could this really be Earth!?" Change its contents by adding to your story. 

Suggested text: 
 > This sure is a strange planet! It can't possibly be Earth. I must have gotten mixed up on my way here.
When you are done editing, close the passage editor by using the Escape key or by clicking the "x" in the upper right corner.

<p align="center">
  <img align="center" width="60%" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/15-%20text%203.png" alt="editing text again">
</p>

### Step 8 - Finish and Save your Story

<img align="right" width="20%" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/17-publish%202.png" alt="pyramid icon and publish to file as HTML">

Keep adding text to your passages. Add more to your story, create new hyperlinks, and add new blocks of text. You can even create a link back to the beginning of your story, using brackets. You can experiment more with links by reading the [Twine Wiki](http://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:how_to_create_links). Then, lay your story again if you'd like (you know how to do this now) and then navigate back to the Passages View. Next, navigate to the menu bar and click on the pyramid next to your story title. Finally, select the option "Publish to File" to save your story as an HTML file that you can open in any browser to play.

## Part 3 - Personalizing Your Twine Story

*Adapted from Miriam Neptune's tutorials on exploring narrative structure with Twine*

In this exercise you will learn how to do the following with Twine: 
1) Change your story's background color
2) Change font type, font size & font color
3) Customize a specific text block
4) Add an image

In this section you will be using the CSS coding language to customize your Twine story. You will need no prior experience in CSS to do this exercise. For reference, here is some basic information from the website [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) about CSS:
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once

**Basic CSS Terms:**

Text Align - Chose between “Left”,”Right”, & “Center

Color - Color of text, name color e.g. Red or Hex e.g. #0635c9

Font Size - Choose any font size number e.g. 18pt

Font Family - Choose any web-safe font

Background Color - Change the color of the individual block

Padding - Distance of text from border (recommendation choose between 1%-15%)

### Changing Background Color

Open the menu on the lower left corner (e.g. mine says “demo”) and then click on “Edit Story Stylesheet." The empty stylesheet can be used to enter CSS code. In this tutorial we will provide basic code that you can copy and paste into your own stylesheet 

<img align="left" width="20%" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/stylesheet.png" alt="edit story stylesheet"> 
<img align="center" width="35%" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/miriam%20-%202%20before.png" alt="story style sheet before"> 
<img align="right" width="35%" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/miriam%20-%203%20after.png" alt="story style sheet after"> 


Copy and paste the CSS code below into your stylesheet. Change background-color to any other color e.g. from “White” to “Red”

```
tw-story {
background-color: White;
}
```

Advanced: Use a [hex number color code](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) e.g. #ed2d2d

```
tw-story {
background-color: #ed2d2d;
}
```

To view your changes, exit the style sheet (no save needed) and click play. Check to see if you like the changes you made. You can always go back and change it to a different color.

### Changing the Font

Open the story stylesheet. Copy and paste the CSS code below into your stylesheet. 

```
tw-passage {
color: Blue;
font-family: garamond;
font-size: 100%;
}
```

Switch out the word "garamond" with any other web-safe font family. For example, you could use "Arial Black" or any other font listed at [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp).

Check to see if you like the changes you made by exiting the style sheet and clicking "play."

### Changing the Font Color

You can change the color of your text by changing the color in your CSS code (shown below) to another color, e.g. from "Blue" to "Pink."  You can also change the color to a hex number color code. Once you've changed your code, check to see the changes you've made by exiting the style sheet and clicking "play."

```
tw-passage {
color: Blue;
font-family: garamond;
font-size: 20pt;
}
```

### Customizing a Specific Block of Text

The CSS codes used in earlier parts of this tutorial will automatically apply to your whole story on Twine, so if you only want to customize a specific text block, you can use the "tag" function. 

First, open a block and add a tag (e.g. "IMATS") with the "+Tag" button. Then, go back to your style sheet.
(photo) (photo)

In order to change the style of the singular block, copy and paste the CSS code below into your style sheet. 

```
tw-passage[tags~="IMATS"]{
text-align: center;
color: White;
font-size: 25pt;
font-family: Comic Sans MS;
background-color: Pink;
padding: 10%;
}
```

To customize your block, replace “IMATS” in the tw-passage[tags~="IMATS"] section to the name of the tag in the block you're trying to customize. Customize the style as you wish by changing the color, font family etc. as you did in the previous sections. Now that you've added a tag name to this set of code in your stylesheet, any changes you make to this block of code will only apply to the block in your story with the matching tag name. 

### Adding an Image

First, choose an image that can be easily inserted into your Twine story. The image should have a url and either be your own image or be a copyright free image. Once you've found the image you'd like to use on Google or another website, right-click the image to "copy image address." Then, open the block you want to add your image to. Copy and paste the CSS code below into the block description (NOT the CSS style sheet). Replace the url in the code with the url you've copied. 

```
<style> 
img {
max-width: 100%;
max-height 100%;
}
</style>

<img src=https://library.barnard.edu/ sites/default/files/inline-images/BLAIS-LIB-Peets_0.jpg></span>
```

Change the size of the image by changing the percentage of max-width and max-height. 

# Reflections:

- What impact does branching narrative have on a story, and you as the reader? What are the challenges of writing in this way?
- How did creating multi-linear passages make you think differently about your project and its content?
