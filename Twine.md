Introduction to the tool
------------------------

Twine is an open-source tool for telling "interactive, nonlinear stories" online at [twinery.org](http://twinery.org/).

### This tool is great for:

- Multi-linear narratives (think choose-your-own-adventure)
- Projects with lots of writing
- Creating interactive fiction and games

### This tool is not great for:

- Visualizing data
- Collaborative projects (You must save and share your Twine story as an HTML file to work collaboratively)

Materials:
----------

- Internet access
- Reliable web browser (preferably Chrome or Firefox)

### Step 1 - Getting Started

- Go to Twinery.org. Here, you have two options for using Twine: you can download the application onto your computer where files will be saved locally in your Documents folder, or you can access the website through your web browser, where stories are saved in the browser's local storage. If you decide to download the application onto your computer, click the download link for your type of computer on the yellow sticky note on the right-hand side of the page. Follow the prompts to download. If you decide to use Twine online, click "use it online" on the yellow sticky note on the right-hand side of the page.
- Important things to remember when using Twine online are that clearing sessions and cookies in a browser may also clear the storage of Twine. If you clear your browser's data, you'll lose your work! Also, you need to use the same browser every time you use Twine because local storage is browser specific. Finally, anyone who uses your browser can see and make changes to your work if they access the Twine website. 

### Step 2 - Creating a New Story

To create a new story, click on the "+ story" symbol below the Twine logo on the right of the page.

Again, if you are using the browser-based version of Twine, the story file will be saved in your browser so if you erase your browser cache, your work will be deleted. Select 'Archive' *to* save your story as an html document. 

<img align="right" width="20%" src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/2-archive.png" alt="Screen grab of Archive Button">

If you are using the desktop version of Twine, your story will be saved to your documents folder. If you would like to archive a particular version of your story, select "Archive" to save the most recently edited version as an html document. 

### Step 3 - Adding Content

Name your story: enter a name for your story (you can change this later!)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/3-name%20story.png" alt="Screen grab of naming story">
</p>

After you name your story, you will find yourself at a page that looks like a blueprint. You are now in the Passages View, where you can view all of the passages of your story. Right now you only have one passage in the middle of the screen labelled "Untitled Passage."

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/4-passage%20view.png" alt="Passages view">
</p>

Double click the box to edit the passage.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/5-untitled%20passage.png" alt="Double click this passage to edit">
</p>

Once opening the passage, you can edit its name, tags, and contents. To change the contents of the passage, double click the text "Double-click this passage to edit it" and add some content of your own.

</p>

If you are just learning how to use twine, we suggest adding the following text: 
 > As soon as the hatch of your ship, the Coriolis, opens, you see the creatures swarming around you. There are many of them, more than you can easily count, and they are all continuously in motion. 
We will build on this content later. 
 
![Adding text](https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/7-text%201.png)

Close the passage editor by using the Escape key or by clicking the "x" in the upper right corner.

### Step 4 - Playing a Story

Now that you've added some text to your story, play your story to see how it looks!

Once you have closed the passage editor and are in Passage View, you can see the Story Menu at the bottom of the screen. This menu allows you to navigate, change, and play your story.

![Story Menu](https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/8-bottom%20menu.png)

Click on the "Play" button in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.  

![Play Button](https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/9-play%20button.png)

Your story will open as an HTML file in your web browser.

### Step 5 - Connecting Passages

Make sure you are in the Passages View. Then, double-tap the "Untitled Passage" again. This time, add text at the bottom. You will be adding double opening and closing square brackets around your text to create a "passage link" to link connecting passages in your story. If you are using the suggested text we have provided, add the following text this time: 
 > [[Could this really be Earth!?]]
 
![Adding more text](https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/11-text%202.png)

If you are exploring how to use Twine using your own story, add your own "next step" to your story. Remember to add two brackets around your phrase in order for your text to become a link to a new page. Close the passage editor by using the Escape key or by clicking the "x" in the upper right corner. Now that you are back in the Passages View, you can see two passages! If you click or drag either passage, you can see that the two passages are connected.

### Step 6 - Playing your Story Again

Now that you've added some more text to your story, play your story to see how it has changed!

Click on the "Play" button in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. Your story will open as an HTML file in your web browser. You can see an updated version of your story that includes the new link you just created. 

![Edited story in new tab](https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/13%20-%20play%202.png)

Passage links act both as connections between stories and as hyperlinks between passages in the story. If you click on the hyperlink, a new passage will load, but the new passage will include the default text "Double-click this passage to edit it."

![Click on hyperlink](https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/14-%20play%202.png)

### Step 7 - Editing your New Passage

Return to the Passage View and double-click the second passage you made. If you've been using the suggested text we've provided, the passage should be named "Could this really be Earth!?" Change its contents by adding to your story. 

Suggested text: 
 > This sure is a strange planet! It can't possibly be Earth. I must have gotten mixed up on my way here.
 
![Editing text again](https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/15-%20text%203.png)

Close the passage editor by using the Escape key or by clicking the "x" in the upper right corner.

### Step 8 - Finish and Save your Story

Keep adding text to your passages. Add more to your story, create new hyperlinks, and add new blocks of text. You can even create a link back to the beginning of your story, using brackets. You can experiment more with links by reading the [Twine Wiki](http://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:how_to_create_links). Then, lay your story again if you'd like (you know how to do this now) and then navigate back to the Passages View. Next, navigate to the menu bar and click on the pyramid next to your story title.

![Pyramid](https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/16-publish%201.png)

Select the option to "Publish to File."

![Publish](https://github.com/dhc-barnard/tutorials/blob/master/images/Twine/17-publish%202.png)

Your story will be saved as an HTML file that you can open in any browser to play.
