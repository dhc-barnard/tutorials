# WordPress Basics

## Introduction to the tool

WordPress is a free and open source content management system. More than 30% of the top 10 million websites use WordPress. Though it started as a simple blog posting site, WordPress now offers various widgets, plugins, and themes for website creation.

## Materials:
- Internet access
- WordPress login information

# Guided Practice
## Step 1: Getting Started
### Log In

Now, to access the content management side of your course website, visit your domain/homepage’s url followed by `/wp-admin.` You will land on this login page.

For login information, you should have received a new user invitation from the wordpress website (e.g. `wordpress@websitename.com`). After resetting your password you will be able to login to the course website with your email address and password.

### Back-End vs. Front-End

After logging in through `/wp-admin`, you will land on the back-end’s administration dashboard which should look similar to this:

*At the info bar across the top you will see your website name (links to site) and your user name (links to profile).*

The back-end page has a dashboard displaying a summary of the activity and content of your website. The sidebar on the left allows you to produce and manage content. Clicking the website title in the upper right corner allows you to switch to the front-end of the website which appears as so:

*This is the front end of the website. Here you can see the website display and add content using the “+ New” menu tab on the top bar.*

Many prefer to work through the front-end of WordPress. Though the back-end of WordPress offers many tools and setting controls, with the front-end you can focus more readily on content creation.

## Step 2: Creating a Post
### Posts

One of the most popular functions of WordPress is its posts, which are very similar to blog posts. WordPress posts are organized by most recent posts. You can assign posts to categories and add tags to your posts for organization.

### Creating a New Post

To create a post through the front-end you can simply select the “+ New” menu tab on the top bar. To create a post through the back-end, hover over the “Posts” button on the sidebar and select “Add New.”

*Create a post: Front-end vs. Back-end*

After initiating a new post, you are taken to WordPress’ block editor. This editor helps you create and manage text and media content. For posts, the block editor consists of sections for your posts’ title and content (text, image, video, headers, etc.). You can add content such as text by clicking the “+” sign buttons either in the topbar or in the block editor.

You can also switch from the visual editor to an HTML editor by clicking the vertical ellipsis symbol on the upper right corner of your display. With the HTML editor you can edit the HTML of the post.

*If you are comfortable writing in HTML, you can further customize your post with the WordPress code editor. The code editor doesn’t render the website style.*

### Adding Media
#### Images

When adding images you have the option to upload an image, select an image from the media library, or insert an image URL. Images uploaded will automatically be added to the media library. However, when uploading images found from the internet, it is important to note that uploading a copy of an image from the internet disconnects the image from its original context and metadata. In addition, uploading a copy of an image adds to the carbon footprint of the server storing it.

*You can add a variety of content with the block editor including images, slideshows, audio, videos, etc.*

When adding an image to the site, it is good practice to add alt text. In the alt text you should describe the function of the image to increase the accessibility of your content. The alt text will appear in the case that the image is not able to load and helps screen-reading tools that describe the image to visually impaired users.

*The alt text can be added through the image settings that pop up as a sidebar when you add an image to your post.*

#### Video & Audio

Inserting video and audio to your post is very similar. Either upload a mp3/mp4 file or insert the URL to the file.

## Step 3: Post Settings

You can toggle the document settings by selecting the gear button at the upper right corner of the display. The following list describes the document settings tabs:

- **Status & Visibility** - Here you can decide the visibility of your post and when it publishes. You can also decide on the author (automatically assigns your user account).
- **Permalink** - Lists the URL of your post.
- **Categories** - You can select the category for your post to fall under.
- **Tags** - Add and select tags for your post.
- **Featured Image** - Add and select the featured image that appears on your post’s preview.
- **Excerpt** - Text that appears on your post’s preview
- **Discussion** - Edit audience interaction settings such as allowing comments.
- **Post Attribute** - Change post template from default template.

### Categories & Tags

Categories and Tags are useful ways to organize posts. Categories are useful for organizing by broader themes or genres, such as books, films, etc. Tags speak more specifically to a post and are more useful in highlighting keywords and more detailed themes featured in posts, such as drama, horror, etc.

*As an author you can create new tags in the document settings sidebar toggled by the gears on the top bar. You can also select which category you want your post to fall under.*

## Step 4: Saving & Publishing your Post

In the same top bar you have the option to save a draft of your post, preview your post, and publish your post. Once you publish your post it will become public based on your document’s visibility settings.
