## Introduction to the tool:
Scalar is a free, open-source tool for digital authoring and publishing that “enables users to assemble media from multiple sources and juxtapose them with their own writing in a variety of ways, with minimal technical expertise required” ([Scalar website](https://scalar.me/anvc/scalar/)).

## Materials:
- Internet access
- Reliable web browser (preferably Chrone or Firefox)
- Access to your email
- An account at [scalar.usc.edu](https://scalar.me/anvc/) or your own Scalar install

## Learning Goals:
- Understand how you might use Scalar to think digitally about narrative structure and autonomous readers
- Create a sample Scalar book to share with your students

### This tool is great for:
- Projects with lots of writing
- Connecting media to text
- Multi-linear narratives (think choose-your-own-adventure)

### This tool is not great for:
- Storing lots of images or large images (if your project is object-centered, try [Omeka](https://www.omeka.net/) or [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/) instead)
