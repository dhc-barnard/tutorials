# Step 1: Getting Started
## Sign Up

To create a Scalar account, follow these instructions:
1. Make your way to the [Scalar Registration Page](https://scalar.usc.edu/works/system/register). 
2. Enter in the relevant information such as your email and name.
3. Use Registration key:
4. Once you've regeistered, you should be redirected to your dashboard, if you are not already on the "My Account Tab," navigate to that tab.
5. There should be an option to create a new book at the bottom of the page which should look like the image below:

6. Once you've created the new book you should be able to see it under "My Books." Click on your book title to navigate to your book. Now it's time to add content!

## Front-end vs. back-end

Many tasks in Scalar are accomplished through Scalar's "front-end" or "public-facing" interface. You'll know you're on the front-end of your Scalar site when you can see a dark grey bar with icons at the top of your screen.  The back-end of the site has "Dashboard" at the top of the page. To move from the dashboard to the front-end, select "Back to book" in the top-right corner. To move from the front-end of your book to your dashboard, select the wrench icon. 

Front-end | Back-end
--------- | --------

*The front-end of a Scalar site* | *The back-end or dashboard of a Scalar site*

# Step 2: Adding Content
## Adding Media

Scalar requires you to add media independent of adding the media to a page. This is because each piece of media on the site is also a page and Scalar doesn't treat images differently (more on Scalar's "flat ontology" in the next section). Once you get the hang of adding media, however, the process is easy!

### Uploading Media

Sometimes it's impossible or impractical to link to media, particularly if that media is at risk of disappearing. In those cases, use Scalar's upload feature. 

1. To upload media from the front-end of your site, hover over the upload button on the right hand side of your book.Then hover over "Files and URLs." Finally, select "Upload media files."
