## Front-end vs. back-end

Many tasks in Scalar are accomplished through Scalar's "front-end" or "public-facing" interface. You'll know you're on the front-end of your Scalar site when you can see a dark grey bar with icons at the top of your screen.  The back-end of the site has "Dashboard" at the top of the page. To move from the dashboard to the front-end, select "Back to book" in the top-right corner. To move from the front-end of your book to your dashboard, select the wrench icon. 

Front-end | Back-end
